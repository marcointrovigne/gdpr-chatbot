In this respect, if an information society service provider makes it clear to potential users that it is only offering its service to persons aged 18 or over, and this is not undermined by other evidence (such as the content of the site or marketing plans) then the service will not be considered to be 'offered directly to a child' and Article 8 will not apply.\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 (2018).\nWhere a data controlleris targeting children or is, or should be, aware that their goods/services are particularly utilised by children (including where the controller is relying on the consentof the child), it should ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language used is appropriate to and resonates with children so that the child addressee of the information recognises that the message/ information is being directed at them. A useful example of child-centred language used as an alternative to the original legal language can be found in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Child Friendly Language.\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679, WP259 rev.01 (2018):\nWhat is reasonable, both in terms of verifying that a user is old enough to provide their own consent, and in terms of verifying that a person providing consent on behalf of a child is a holder of parental responsibility, may depend upon the risks inherent in the processing as well as the available technology. In low-risk cases, verification of parental responsibility via email may be sufficient. Conversely, in high-risk cases, it may be appropriate to ask for more proof, so that the controller is able to verify and retain the information pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR. Trusted third party verification services may offer solutions which minimise the amount of personal data the controller has to process itself.\n\nArticle 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2009 on the Protection of Children's Personal Data (General Guidelines and the Special Case of Schools) (2009).\nEDPB, Guidelines 5/2020 on Consent under Regulation 2016/679 (2020).\nICO, Age Appropriate Design: A Code of Practice for Online Services (2020).\nCJEU, Data Protection Commissioner/Facebook Ireland Ltd and Schrems, C-311/18 (2020).",
