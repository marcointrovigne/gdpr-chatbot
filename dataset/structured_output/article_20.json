    "expert_commentary": "The right to data portability is presented primarily as a way to support \"user choice, user control, and user empowerment\" (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability), as it aims at reinforcing an individual's control over her/his personal information (recital 68). Data portability allows users to receive a copy of their personal data and can be seen in that sense as an extension of the right of access (article 15). It can also help them to switch services without losing their data, enabling users to transfer their information from one service to a potentially better one.\n\nArticle 20 provides for a general right to data portability, which may be decomposed into two separate rights: i) a right to receive one's personal data \"in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format \"; and ii) a right to transmit the received data without interference. Portability can be invoked if the following conditions are respected:\ndata has been collected based on consent[article 6 (1) (a)or 9 (2) (a)] or on a contract [article 6 (1) (b)]; and they were processed by automated means, which excludes most paper files (Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability).\n\nWhat are the data concerned by the portability right? Article 20 says it is the data \"provided\" by a person. The Guidelines on the Right to Data Portability specifies that this word must be interpreted broadly. It recommends that data derived from the activities of users (logs, browsing history, search activities, location, and so on) should be treated as data \"provided\" by a user. Therefore, the right covers not only the data actively and directly volunteered by users, but also those generated by their activity while using the application, device or service in question. The official interpretation extends the reach of the right to data portability beyond the text of the article itself and the legislative intent of the Council and the Parliament, some critics say.",

Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on the basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive personal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain processing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and freedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in this Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject which have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject should have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another."
